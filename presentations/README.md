### COMM318_Mini-Presentation.pdf:

This presentation answers three sets of questions.

  3. What are your planned analyses?

Group 3's presentation has six slides, two of which act as introductions. The other four slides disucss the research question, the data collection process, and a number of planned analyses. The presenation can be found in this folder (COMM318_Mini-Presentation.pdf), or it can be viewed at the following link:

### COMM318_The-Baseball-Group_FINAL-Presentation.pdf:

This presentation acts as an update to the previous presentation and builds upon the ideas and more general objectives laid out previously. 

The first few slides serve as refreshers to the original ideas, research questions, and general terminology. After this, the presentation is broken down into three separate analysis categories, comparing two statistics:
  1. Release extension and batting average against
  2. Horizontal release point and exit velocity
  3. Pitch velocity and whiffs

After running through each of the three categories and the ensuing findings, the presentation ends with next steps and the planned further analyses. The presenation can be found in this folder (COMM318_The-Baseball-Group_FINAL-Presentation.pdf), or it can be viewed at the following link:
