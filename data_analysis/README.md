# Data analysis for COMM318 Group Project

## This is the data analysis folder, in which all data was prelimininarily investigated for further analysis in future steps.

### There are two main folders to note:

1. _Initial_Notebooks_: This folder contains all notebooks that were used in the initial observation steps, meaning that there had been little to no previous work done before these steps. This includes Step 1.

2. _Intermediate_Notebooks_: This folder contains all notebooks that were used in the intermediate steps of the project, meaning that they build off of the first folder of notebooks and are best viewed second. This includes Step 2.

### Within each folder, there are a multitude of files:

#### 1. _Initial_Notebooks_:
