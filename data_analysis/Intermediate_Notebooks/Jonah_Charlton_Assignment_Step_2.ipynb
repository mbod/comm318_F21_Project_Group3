    "By further investigating the top 5 starters with the highest release extensions, we find that there is a strong relationship between batting average against and the release extension. Tyler Glasnow's 7.30 release extension leads to one of the lowest batting average against scores, only outdone by Freddy Peralta who has a similarly high 7.17 release extension."

    "This step builds off of our prior result in Block 3, which worked on the releationship between release extension and batting average against. We see that the higher release extensions tends to lead to a lower batting average against and we can note that it is definitely a key metric for judging success."

    "### ANSWER: \n",
    "There is a positive relationship between release extension and whiffs. The starter with the highest number of whiffs is Freddy Peralta, a name we have seen pop up a number of times and exhibits the second highest release extension. The highest release extension — which belongs to Tyler Glasnow — falls behind and is an outlier on the positive correlation here; this is due to the fact that Glasnow was injured mid-season and faced fewer hitters. Without Glasnow, the relationship will appear even more positive."

    "Throughout the Blocks, we have built upon the notions regarding the stark importance of release extension to the success of starting pitchers in the MLB. In this block we see again that there is an important relationship between release extension and whiffs, another important indicator of success for a starting pitcher."
